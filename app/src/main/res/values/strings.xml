    <string name="forthedonorheader">What happens after you donate blood? </string>
    <string name="whathappend">After the blood donation is completed, all blood units are transferred to laboratories for testing and processing.
    This should be done as soon as possible after the blood sampling is completed to ensure processing and preparation for as long as possible.
        as many blood products as possible.</string>
    <string name="Saveheader">Storage</string>
    <string name="Storage"> After the end of the tests, special labels are placed on the blood units that indicate the results of the tests and the
        blood type (the procedure is called marking) as well as the expiration limit and then the units are placed in the refrigerators ready
        to be distributed to anyone in need. Conditions vary depending on the product.</string>
    <string name="tobeHeader">Would you like to donate blood but have not yet decided? </string>

        percentage of about 1.5% are blood donors. If you are healthy, chances are you can donate blood and thus help the numbers come out.
